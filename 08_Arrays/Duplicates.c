	Task: Write a program with the following behaviour:
			a) Ask the user to enter a positive number n. This will be the number of the numbers the user is allowed to enter.
			b) Ask the user to enter n unique integers, one by one. If the user has already entered the number, communicate that fact and discard the number.
			c) When the user has entered n unique integers, compute the sum and print it.
